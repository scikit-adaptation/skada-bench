Cross-validation Score Analysis
-----------------------------

This section analyzes the relationship between cross-validation scores and accuracy for different supervised and unsupervised scorers. The Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) is reported for each scorer. Each point in the visualization represents an inner split with a specific Domain Adaptation method (indicated by color) and dataset. A good scorer should demonstrate strong correlation with the target accuracy.
