## Adding a New DA Method

To add a new DA method, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Solver Class:**
   - Navigate to the `solvers` folder.
   - Create a new Python file for your method.
   - Define a class called `Solver` that inherits from `DASolver`.
   - Implement the `get_estimator()` function, which returns a class inheriting from `sklearn.BaseEstimator`.
   - See `_solvers_scorers_registry.py` on how to add the new solver to the benchmark registry. 

### Example DA Method

Here's an example of how to add a new DA method:

```python
from benchmark_utils.base_solver import DASolver
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator

class MyDAEstimator(BaseEstimator):
    def __init__(self, param1=10, param2='auto'):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2

    def fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):
        # sample_weight<0 are source samples
        # sample_weight>=0 are target samples
        # y contains -1 for masked target samples
        # Your code here: store stuff in self for later predict
        return self

    def predict(self, X):
        # Do prediction on target domain here
        return ypred

    def predict_proba(self, X):
        # Do probabilistic prediction on target domain here
        return proba

class Solver(DASolver):
    name = "My_DA_method"
    
    # Param grid to validate
    default_param_grid = {
        'param1': [10, 100],
        'param2': ['auto', 'manual']
    }
    
    def get_estimator(self):
        return MyDAEstimator()
```

## Adding a New Dataset

To add a new dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Dataset Class:**
   - Navigate to the `datasets` folder.
   - Create a new Python file for your dataset.
   - Define a class called `Dataset` that inherits from `BaseDataset`.
   - Implement the `get_data()` function, which returns a dictionary with keys `X`, `y`, and `sample_domain`.

### Example Dataset

Here's an example of how to add a new dataset:

```python
from benchopt import BaseDataset
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import numpy as np

class Dataset(BaseDataset):
    name = "example_dataset"
    
    def get_data(self):
        X_source, y_source = make_blobs(
            n_samples=100, centers=3,
            n_features=2, random_state=0
        )
        X_target, y_target = make_blobs(
            n_samples=100, centers=5,
            n_features=2, random_state=42
        )
        # sample_domain is negative for target samples and positive for source
        sample_domain = np.array([1]*len(X_source) + [-2]*len(X_target))
        
        return dict(
            X=np.concatenate((X_source, X_target), axis=0),
            y=np.concatenate((y_source, y_target)),
            sample_domain=sample_domain
        )
```

## Adding a New Scorer

To add a new scorer, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Scorer Class:**
   - Create a new Python file for your scorer.
   - Define a class for your scorer.
   - Implement the `_score()` function, which returns a `float`.

2. **Add your Scorer to the benchmark:**
   - Navigate to the `benchmark_utils` folder.
   - Open the `scorers` Python file.
   - Import and add your scorer to the `CRITERIONS` dictionnary.
   - See `_solvers_scorers_registry.py` on how to add the new scorer to the benchmark registry. 

### Example Scorer

Here's an example of how to add a new scorer:

```python
from benchopt import safe_import_context

with safe_import_context() as import_ctx:
    from skada.metrics import (
        SupervisedScorer,
        PredictionEntropyScorer,
        ImportanceWeightedScorer,
        SoftNeighborhoodDensity,
        DeepEmbeddedValidation,
        CircularValidation,
    )

CRITERIONS = {
    'supervised': SupervisedScorer(),
    'prediction_entropy': PredictionEntropyScorer(),
    'importance_weighted': ImportanceWeightedScorer(),
    'soft_neighborhood_density': SoftNeighborhoodDensity(),
    'deep_embedded_validation': DeepEmbeddedValidation(),
    'circular_validation': CircularValidation()
}
```
